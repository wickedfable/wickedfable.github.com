When I am not messing about, I work as a [freelance graphic designer] (http://spiffup.org). Below you can find the repositories for some of my projects:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n[Vegetarians Are Crazy](https://github.com/wickedfable/vegetarians-are-crazy)\r\n* Plugin for Minecraft Bukkit servers that makes some crafting recipes vegetarian-friendly. \r\n\r\n[Walk Like Us](https://github.com/wickedfable/walk-like-us)\r\n* Mod for Skyrim that allows players to disguise themselves in order to blend in with NPCs. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Goodbye!\r\nSorry, mate, but I have to run. If you would like to get into contact with me, you can shoot an email over to wicked.fable@gmail.com  I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","note":"Don't delete this file!
